            <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
            <img class="background" src="../IMAGENES/background.png" >
            <p2>OMORI features many traditional RPG elements but contains a very
                unique battle system. The player controls a party of four characters
                who travel through the game's colorful two-dimensional world with
                no accessible overworld map. Areas can "loop" into each other,
                making the two-dimensional OMORI-verse feel uniquely three-
                dimensional.

            <h3>BATTLES</h3>
            <p4>The battle system in OMORI is described as "a traditional turn-based
                battle system with untraditional statuses and states based off real
                human emotions and conditions". When physical contact occurs
                between a character and an enemy on the map, the screen switches
                to battle mode.

                level up. This increases the character's attributes such as attack,
                defense, speed, luck, accuracy, juice and heart.

            <h4>EMOTIONS</h4>
            <p6>Friends and enemies can be affected by emotion. Emotions can be
                changed by using a skill or item during battle. Certain ENEMIES'S
                abilities may also affect characters' emotions. Different emotions
                have different effects and last for a few turns. The default emotion is
                always NEUTRAL.
