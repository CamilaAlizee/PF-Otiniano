                unique battle system. The player controls a party of four characters
                who travel through the game's colorful two-dimensional world with
                no accessible overworld map. Areas can "loop" into each other,
                making the two-dimensional OMORI-verse feel uniquely three-

                    The battle system in OMORI is described as "a traditional turn-based
                    battle system with untraditional statuses and states based off real
                    human emotions and conditions". When physical contact occurs
                    between a character and an enemy on the map, the screen switches
                    to battle mode.
